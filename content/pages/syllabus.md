## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: ?? sessions / week, ?? hours / session

## Prerequisites

[*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/) or [*18.06 Linear Algebra*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)

## Course Description

This course introduces students to selected aspects of geometry and topology, using concepts that can be visualized easily. In this course we mix geometric topics (such as hyperbolic geometry or billiards) and more topological ones (such as loops in the plane). The course is suitable for students with no prior exposure to differential geometry or topology.

## Topics

Here are some of the topics covered:

- Polygons
- Billiards
- The principal frequency
- Loops
- Immersed loops
- Algebraic curves
- Two-dimensional complexes
- Hyperbolic geometry
- Curved geometries
