## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

## Prerequisites

[*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/) or [*18.06 Linear Algebra*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)

## Course Description

This course introduces students to selected aspects of geometry and topology, using concepts that can be visualized easily. In this course we mix geometric topics (such as hyperbolic geometry or billiards) and more topological ones (such as loops in the plane). The course is suitable for students with no prior exposure to differential geometry or topology.

Think of this class as a moderate hike, overlooking various parts of the geometry and topology landscape. Bits are flat, bits are uphill, there are occasional rocky parts (may be different for everyone), but none that are designed to be cliff faces. The class moves from one topic to the next quickly, so it’s important to learn continuously.

## Topics

Here are some of the topics covered:

- Polygons
- Billiards
- The principal frequency
- Loops
- Immersed loops
- Algebraic curves
- Two-dimensional complexes
- Hyperbolic geometry
- Curved geometries

## Homework

There is one short homework each class and one long homework each week.

## Exams

There are four in-class midterm exams (and no final).

## Grading

Short homework 30%, long homework 30%, midterm exams 40% (10% each). There will be no rounding, dropping worst score, “curving”, or other statistical manipulations.
